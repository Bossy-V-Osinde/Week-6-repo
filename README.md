# AI Future Direction Assignment
This project explores various aspects of Artificial Intelligence, including theoretical foundations, practical implementation, and future applications. It is divided into three main parts:

## Part 1: Theoretical Analysis 
This section includes essay-based questions and a case study critique. It focuses on understanding how AI technologies like Edge AI, Quantum AI, and Human-AI collaboration impact different industries and society. It also involves analyzing real-world applications such as smart cities and traffic systems.

## art 2: Practical Implementation 
This part involves hands-on AI work such as model development, prototyping, and system design. It includes building and testing lightweight AI models, proposing smart systems using AI and IoT, and evaluating ethical considerations in fields like personalized medicine.

## Part 3: Futuristic Proposal 
The final section is a creative concept proposal. It involves imagining a new AI application for the future, outlining how it would work, the problem it solves, and its possible risks and benefits to society.
